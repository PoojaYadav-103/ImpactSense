## 🎯 Problem Statement

Earthquakes cause massive loss of life and property worldwide. Timely and accurate classification of earthquake impact is crucial for:

* Emergency preparedness
* Resource allocation
* Evacuation planning
* Public safety measures

### 💡 Solution

ImpactSense uses machine learning models to **classify earthquake alert levels in real time** based on seismic features, enabling actionable and early decision-making.

---

## 🚨 Alert Classification Levels

* 🟢 **Green Alert – Minimal Impact**
  Normal operations, low risk
* 🟡 **Yellow Alert – Low Impact**
  Stay alert, prepare emergency supplies
* 🟠 **Orange Alert – Moderate Impact**
  Activate response teams, evacuate vulnerable areas
* 🔴 **Red Alert – High Impact**
  Immediate evacuation, critical risk
